# What is this?
This is my first attempt at making a form app with C#. It is completely useless, as it does not save data once closed(hence *temporary* note-taking app), but could have some use, nevertheless. 

Btw this was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vAx0kObdps) video. If the video is down ask me for a torrent/download of it or something, or look it up on archive.org.

# How do I compile this if I want to use it, even though it is completely useless?
I suggest you just open the .sln solution file in Visual Studio and it will auto-compile the project for you. 😉

# How to make it auto-compile because I am stoopid :^)?
Press the green run button at the top 🙂.

# I don't want to compile because too lazy 🤡 so where is polished executable?
🤡🤡🤡 You know what, saaaaaaaaaaame. 😅 *Anyhow* you can fined a polished executable, with version information and icon injected via Resource Hacker already included in the repository, or you can find the "formal release" in the releases section. 🤣 Thanks for taking a look. Note that it is ***not*** code-signed, meaning that *yes*, your antivirus will make a big fuss out of it. Mark it as safe to prevent issues with your antivirus. That's why it's a better idea to compile it yourself, since that way, your antivirus will recongnise that, *oh, the local computer made it*, and not block it or something.

# Why is it not an unlicense this time?
Because I actually spent time and effort into this one 🤣🤡🤣 so, similar to the powershell repository, please credit me when referencing, sharing, or doing something with this at the right times 😔. Please 😥.

# Conclusion...
Have fun with this useless project! 😃

One more thing: If you click read or delete when there is no saved note, there will be an error, as there is no note to read or delete. Idk how do fix, so please ignore 😔.

# What is this?
This is my first attempt at making a form app with C#. It is completely useless, as it does not save data once closed(hence *temporary* note-taking app), but could have some use, nevertheless. 

# How do I compile this if I want to use it, even though it is completely useless?
I suggest you just open the solution file in Visual Studio and it will auto-compile the project for you. ðŸ˜‰

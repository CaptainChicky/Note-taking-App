# What is this?
This is my first attempt at making a form app with C#. It is completely useless, as it does not save data once closed(hence *temporary* note-taking app), but could have some use, nevertheless. 

Btw this was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vAx0kObdps) video. If the video is down ask me for a torrent/download of it or something, or look it up on archive.org.

# How do I compile this if I want to use it, even though it is completely useless?
I suggest you just open the .sln solution file in Visual Studio and it will auto-compile the project for you. ðŸ˜‰

# How to make it auto-compile because I am stoopid :^)?
Press the green run button at the top ðŸ™‚.

# Conclusion...
Have fun with this useless project! :D
